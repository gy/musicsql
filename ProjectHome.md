MusicSQL is a system for conducting complex searches of symbolic polyphonic music databases. Searches are constructed relationally and can be multidimensional, searching for patterns in multiple voices and other musical parameters. The database can import and export MusicXML files. In the current version searches are constructed using a command line interface or through simple Python scripting tools.

You can download a ReadMe file and the latest version of MusicSQL from the Downloads section in the sidebar (or from the Downloads tab above). Installation and usage instructions are provided in the ReadMe file.
