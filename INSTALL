MusicSQL installation

Before installing MusicSQL, you must first install some additional
software: 

1. An SQL database server. 

   MySQL (preferred): 

     http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/

   PostgreSQL:

     http://www.postgresql.org/download/

   SQLite is popular, but it does not have the ability to optimize
   complex queries like those generated by MusicSQL. Support for other
   professional databases (Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.) can be
   added as demand arises.

2. Some Python packages.

   On Windows you will also need to install Python (www.python.org).

  [Note: You will not always be able to install these packages out of
  the box in Windows. If you get an error like "'python' is not
  recognized", then you need to edit your environmental variables. Add
  the Python directory (usually "c:\Python25" or something similar) to
  your PATH variable. If you installed LilyPond then it probably
  automatically put its embedded Python interpreter onto PATH, but
  that version of Python lacks the ability to install new libraries,
  and you must put the main Python ahead of LilyPond on the PATH. In
  order to run "musicsqlcmd" you may also need to edit the registry
  value of HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Python\shell\open\command. What a great
  OS.]

   SQLalchemy (version 0.5 or greater):

     http://www.sqlalchemy.org/download.html

   The Python module for your database.

     MySQL: 

       http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/

     PostgreSQL:

       http://initd.org/pub/software/psycopg/

     Note that the database modules will sometimes be installed
     automatically with the database itself (usually in Linux).

3. Lilypond, if you want to generate music notation from your
   searches:

   http://lilypond.org/web/install/

   If LilyPond is installed in a non-default location, you may need to
   edit the CONFIG file to point to the location of Lilypond.
